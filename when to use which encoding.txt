#Conversion of Categorical features into numerical features

1.OneHotEncoding:when there is no ranking available eg:gender(Male,Female) color(Green,Blue,Car)
2.Label Encoding:when there is ranking provided eg:Qualification(Btech,Mtech,PHD), Salary(low,medium,High)
3.Ordinal Encoding:same as labelencoding when there is a clear order defined eg:temperature(low,medium,high)
4.Count or frequency Encoding:When dealing with categorical variables that have a large number of unique categories (high cardinality),reduces overfitting
5.Targeted Guide Ordinal Encoding:
6.Targeted Mean Encoding: When dealing with categorical variables with a high number of distinct categories, target mean encoding can provide a more compact representation compared to one-hot encoding,increases overfitting.
7.Probability ratio Encoding: when there is high cardinality of the unique features and in imbalanced classes

#Missing value techniques 

1.Mean/Median Imputation
2.Random Sample Imputation
3.Capturing NaN to a new feature
4.End of distribution Imputation
5.Arbitrary imputation
6. Frequent categories imputation
